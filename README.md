# Frontend + AWS

## Overview

This project provides two examples of a frontend application, showcasing different authentication approaches:

1. **Frontend without Authentication:** This example demonstrates a simple frontend application that does not require user authentication. Users can access various features of the application without the need to sign in.

2. **Frontend with Authentication (AWS Amplify and Cognito):** In this example, we implement user authentication using AWS Amplify and AWS Cognito. Users are required to sign in to access certain features, ensuring data security and user-specific functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before running either of the frontend examples, ensure that you have the following prerequisites set up:

- Node.js and npm installed
- AWS Amplify CLI installed (for the authenticated example)
- AWS account with AWS Cognito user pool configured (for the authenticated example)
